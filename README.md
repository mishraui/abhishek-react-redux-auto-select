# React Redux minimal starter kit (boilerplate)




I used Redux-minimal starter kit to start the porject as a boilerplate.

Redux-Minimal is a minimalist react-redux starter kit (boilerplate) which let's you build rich real world apps. 


1. Once your environment is prepared that is node and npm, open a command prompt (terminal) and type in the following:

    ```sh
    cd C:\js\node\apps
    git clone https://github.com/catalin-luntraru/redux-minimal.git hello-world
    cd hello-world
    npm install
    npm start
    ```

2. Then open your [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) to see the included small users app.
